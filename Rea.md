🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Integration 📡
Gather urban data from various sources like IoT sensors, APIs, and smart systems. This data can include traffic patterns, air quality, population density, and land usage.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔎
Perform data exploration using libraries like Pandas and Seaborn. Visualize the relationships between urban variables to identify trends and patterns.

3. Model Building 🏗️
Use Random Forest (a machine learning algorithm) to predict urban trends like traffic flow, pollution levels, and energy consumption. Fine-tune the model for accuracy.

4. Geospatial Analysis 🌍
Utilize Geopandas and OSMnx to map city layouts and analyze how geographic factors influence urban planning decisions.

5. Interactive Web Application 🌐
Build a Streamlit application to showcase the model's predictions and allow users to interact with the urban data visualizations in real-time.

🧑‍🏫 Learning Outcomes
GIS Skills: Understand how to perform geospatial analysis for urban planning. 🗺️
Data Science: Learn the basics of EDA, model building, and data visualization. 📊
AI & Machine Learning: Apply machine learning techniques like Random Forest for prediction. 🤖
