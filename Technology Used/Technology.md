- Analyzing urban spatial relationships

---

### 6. **OSMnx 🗺️**

**Why OSMnx?**  
OSMnx is a library for downloading, modeling, and visualizing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It helps in extracting urban infrastructure like streets and buildings for further analysis.

**Key Uses:**
- Extracting and analyzing street networks and urban features
- Visualizing city maps and infrastructure

---

### 7. **Streamlit 🌐**

**Why Streamlit?**  
Streamlit is a framework for creating web applications with minimal code. It’s used in this project to build interactive dashboards for displaying predictions, visualizations, and real-time urban data.

**Key Uses:**
- Creating interactive web apps to showcase machine learning results
- Building user-friendly dashboards for urban planning decisions

---

### 8. **Matplotlib 📊**

**Why Matplotlib?**  
Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python that generates static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It is used for creating basic visualizations of urban data and model results.

**Key Uses:**
- Creating static visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots
- Displaying the results of urban planning models

---

### 9. **Seaborn 📉**

**Why Seaborn?**  
Seaborn is a Python library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. It helps make more sophisticated visualizations.

**Key Uses:**
- Enhancing data visualizations with better aesthetics
- Generating heatmaps, correlation matrices, and other advanced plots

---

### 10. **Plotly 🌐**

**Why Plotly?**  
Plotly is an interactive graphing library that enables the creation of web-based visualizations. It is used to create interactive maps and graphs, which can be manipulated by the user.

**Key Uses:**
- Creating interactive charts and maps
- Allowing users to interact with and explore urban data

---

### 11. **Google Colab ⚡**

**Why Google Colab?**  
Google Colab is a cloud-based environment that provides free access to GPUs and a Jupyter notebook interface. It is used for training large machine learning models that require high computational power.

**Key Uses:**
- Running resource-intensive deep learning models
- Leveraging free GPU support for faster model training

---

### 12. **VS Code 🔥**

**Why VS Code?**  
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight yet powerful code editor. It is used for writing, debugging, and running Python code during the development process.

**Key Uses:**
- Code editing, debugging, and version control
- Integration with Git for collaboration

---

## Conclusion

The combination of these technologies makes the **AI-Based Urban Planning** project a powerful tool for improving urban spaces. Python serves as the backbone of the project, while TensorFlow and Scikit-learn enable machine learning and AI capabilities. Streamlit and Plotly bring interactivity to the visualizations, and Geopandas and OSMnx ensure that spatial data is well-analyzed. With these technologies, we can build smarter, more efficient cities that better serve their inhabitants.
