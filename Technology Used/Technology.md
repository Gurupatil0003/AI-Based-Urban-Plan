print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)


```

### 5. **Geopandas üåç**

**Why Geopandas?**  
Geopandas extends the functionality of pandas to handle geospatial data. It is essential for spatial analysis, as urban planning heavily depends on geographic data.

**Key Uses:**

- Analyzing urban spatial relationships

---
```python
import geopandas as gpd

# Load geospatial data (e.g., city boundaries)
city_map = gpd.read_file("city_shapefile.shp")

# Plot the city map
city_map.plot()

```

### 6. **OSMnx üó∫Ô∏è**

**Why OSMnx?**  
OSMnx is a library for downloading, modeling, and visualizing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It helps in extracting urban infrastructure like streets and buildings for further analysis.

**Key Uses:**
- Extracting and analyzing street networks and urban features
- Visualizing city maps and infrastructure

---

```python
import osmnx as ox

# Download street network for a city (e.g., San Francisco)
city_graph = ox.graph_from_place('San Francisco, California, USA', network_type='all')

# Plot the street network
ox.plot_graph(city_graph)


```

### 7. **Streamlit üåê**

**Why Streamlit?**  
Streamlit is a framework for creating web applications with minimal code. It‚Äôs used in this project to build interactive dashboards for displaying predictions, visualizations, and real-time urban data.

## Conclusion

The combination of these technologies makes the **AI-Based Urban Planning** project a powerful tool for improving urban spaces. Python serves as the backbone of the project, while TensorFlow and Scikit-learn enable machine learning and AI capabilities. Streamlit and Plotly bring interactivity to the visualizations, and Geopandas and OSMnx ensure that spatial data is well-analyzed. With these technologies, we can build smarter, more efficient cities that better serve their inhabitants.
