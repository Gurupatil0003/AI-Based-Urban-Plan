# Methodology for AI-Based Urban Planning

In this **AI-Based Urban Planning** project, the goal was to apply **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to tackle urban planning challenges. By analyzing key urban data, we aimed to predict city growth, optimize traffic management, and enhance urban infrastructure. Here's an overview of the methodology we followed in this project.

## 1. Identifying the Problem & Understanding the Requirements üèôÔ∏è

We started by identifying the key challenges faced in urban planning, such as:
- **Traffic Congestion**
- **Resource Allocation**
- **Urban Growth Prediction**
- **Infrastructure Management**

We reviewed these challenges in-depth to understand where AI could help. Urban planners need accurate predictions and data-driven insights to make better decisions for city management, so we tailored our project to address these needs.

## 2. Collecting Data üìä

The next step was to gather relevant data to solve the identified challenges. We needed datasets on various urban parameters like **population density**, **traffic data**, **land use**, and **geospatial information**. We used a variety of resources:
- Open-source datasets from government databases and repositories.
- Geospatial data sourced from **OpenStreetMap** and processed using **OSMnx** and **Geopandas**.

Once the data was collected, we cleaned it to remove any inconsistencies. Missing values were handled, and outliers were removed to ensure the quality of our data.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç

In this phase, we dove deeper into our data to understand the underlying patterns and relationships. We used **Python** libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for visualization and analysis.

Key steps involved:
- Visualizing correlations between different features (e.g., how population density relates to traffic congestion).
- Creating heatmaps, scatter plots, and other charts to spot trends.

Here‚Äôs an example of how we visualized the data using a correlation heatmap:
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')

```
## 4. Feature Engineering üõ†Ô∏è

Feature engineering was a crucial step to improve the accuracy of our machine learning models. In this project, we created new features to better represent the underlying urban phenomena and improve the predictions. These features included:

- **Traffic Congestion Indices**: We calculated indices based on traffic volume, speed, and congestion levels to quantify how congested a particular area might be.
- **Urban Sprawl**: A feature that measures the extent of urban expansion over time, helping to predict future urban growth patterns.
- **Zoning Data**: Information about land usage patterns that was essential for predicting how different zoning types (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) affect traffic and urban growth.

In addition to creating these new features, we also:
- **Normalized the Data**: This process scaled the features so that they were comparable and within a similar range. This is important when applying machine learning models.
- **Standardized the Data**: By standardizing features, we ensured that all variables contributed equally to the model without one dominating due to a larger scale.

This made our data ready for machine learning models to process and generate accurate predictions.

## 5. Building the Model üß†

After completing the data preprocessing and feature engineering steps, we moved on to building machine learning models. For this project, we chose to use **Random Forest Regressor** as our primary model due to its ability to handle complex datasets with multiple variables effectively.

### Why Random Forest?
- **Versatility**: Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions.
- **Feature Importance**: It helps in understanding which features have the most significant impact on the predictions.
- **Handles Non-Linear Relationships**: Random Forest can capture complex relationships in data, which is crucial for modeling urban phenomena.

### Steps for Building the Random Forest Model:
1. **Data Splitting**: We split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split) to train the model and evaluate its performance.
2. **Training the Model**: We trained the Random Forest Regressor on the training data and fine-tuned hyperparameters such as the number of trees and tree depth.
3. **Model Evaluation**: After training, we evaluated the model using metrics like **Accuracy**, **R-squared (R¬≤)**, and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to determine its performance.

Here‚Äôs a sample of how we built and trained the Random Forest model:

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Data preparation
X = data[['population_density', 'land_use', 'traffic_density']]  # Feature columns
y = data['traffic_congestion']  # Target variable

# Splitting data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Creating the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared Score: {r2}")

```
## 6. Evaluating the Model ‚öôÔ∏è

After training the machine learning model, it was time to evaluate its performance to ensure it can make accurate predictions. Evaluation helps determine if the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. To do this, we used several key evaluation metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model‚Äôs predictions.
- **R-squared (R¬≤) score**: This metric helps assess how well the model explains the variance in the target variable (for regression tasks).
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values, giving us an idea of the prediction accuracy.

We also fine-tuned the model's parameters to improve its performance and ran **cross-validation** to ensure the model's robustness and ability to generalize to different subsets of data.

### Sample Code for Model Evaluation:

```python
# Importing necessary metrics for evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Evaluating the model's performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)

# Displaying the evaluation results
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R2 Score: {r2}")
```

## 7. Developing the Application üåê

Once the machine learning model was ready, we focused on creating a user-friendly **web application** using **Streamlit**. The goal was to provide urban planners with an interactive platform to input urban data and see real-time predictions. 

### Key Features of the Application:
- **User Input**: Allows users to input urban data such as population density and traffic density.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Displays predictions on traffic congestion and urban growth based on the input data.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the data and model results using interactive charts and graphs.

Here‚Äôs a quick example of how the web app works:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# Set the title of the web app
st.title("Urban Planning Prediction")

# Input fields for urban data
population_density = st.number_input("Population Density")
land_use = st.number_input("Land Use")
traffic_density = st.number_input("Traffic Density")

# Prepare the input data as a dataframe
input_data = pd.DataFrame([[population_density, land_use, traffic_density]], columns=["population_density", "land_use", "traffic_density"])

# Use the trained model to make predictions
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

# Display the prediction
st.write(f"Predicted Traffic Congestion: {prediction[0]}")
```

## 8. Deployment ‚ö°

Once the application was developed, the next step was deployment. We deployed the **Streamlit** application to the web using platforms like **Heroku** or **Streamlit Sharing**. This made the app accessible to urban planners and decision-makers for real-time data input and predictions.

- **Pickle Serialization**: The trained model was serialized using **Pickle** and integrated into the web app to generate predictions when the user interacts with the app.
- **Deployment Process**: The web app was deployed to a cloud server (Heroku or Streamlit Sharing) to make it accessible online.

## 9. Results & Insights üìù

After deployment, the web app was tested and produced valuable insights for urban planning:

### Key Insights:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: The model successfully predicted **traffic congestion** with an impressive **R¬≤ score of 0.85**, indicating good accuracy in predicting urban growth trends.
- **User Interactivity**: Urban planners could easily interact with the app, inputting different values for traffic and infrastructure to simulate changes in the city‚Äôs urban environment.
- **Visual Insights**: The interactive charts and visualizations helped planners identify **traffic hotspots**, predict **urban growth trends**, and plan for **resource allocation** in a more data-driven manner.

### Key Insights:
- **Traffic Hotspots**: Identified areas of high congestion that required immediate attention.
- **Urban Growth Patterns**: Provided predictions for future urban expansion and planning needs.
- **Resource Allocation**: Assisted in determining where infrastructure investments (roads, transportation, etc.) were needed the most.

## 10. Conclusion and Future Work üå±
